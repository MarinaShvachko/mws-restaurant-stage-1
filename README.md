# Restaurant Reviews: Stage 1

## Project Overview:

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, we should convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application and accessible for screen reader use. We also should add a service worker to provide offline work of the website.



### How open my website?

1. Git clone https://github.com/MarinaShvachko/mws-restaurant-stage-1.git

2. Open a terminal (cmd in Windows), check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website https://www.python.org/ to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`there you can see the website

4. For checking offline work you should open a Developer tools (Ctrl + Shift + I  for Chrome) and choose "Offline" 

#### For checking a screen reader work I recommend:

1. Open Google Chrome https://www.google.ru/chrome/

2. Install an Extension ChromeVox https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=ru (it is free)

3. Activate ChromeVox

4. Go to site localhost:8000
